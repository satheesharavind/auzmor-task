/* ======
** Mixins
** ======
** Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist.
** A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
** You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes.
*/

/* Example:
** SCSS
	@mixin border-radius($radius) {
	  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
	     -moz-border-radius: $radius;
	      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
	          border-radius: $radius;
	}

** CSS
	.box { @include border-radius(10px); }
